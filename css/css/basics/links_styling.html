            <h2>Section 1</h2>
            <p>A fantastic start for the West Indies with the early wickets of Rahul and Pujara 
            today before Agarwal and Kohli consolidated with a solid partnership, the former getting 
            to his third fifty. Rahane then joined Kohli before he was nicked off by Roach. 
            Kohli seemed to be coasting towards yet another hundred before he was squared up by a 
            Holder away-seamer. Vihari and Pant then played some fluent strokes to take the Indians 
            through to stumps. Holder was easily the pick of the bowlers, scalping three Indians, 
            featuring Cornwall and Roach picking up a wicket each. That's it from our team on Day 1. 
            We'll be back with continued coverage tomorrow. Ciao!</p>
